## My Favorite Series

### 1. Fleabag
- *Written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge*
- *Directed by Harry Bradbeer and Tim Kirkby* 
- *Genre: dark comedy*
- This show is probably the closest to being my all-time favorite show! It is a dark comedy that includes coping with grief and self-hatred. It may seem dark and serious, which it really is, but it is still overwhelmingly funny. It made me cry, but also made me laugh out loud. 
- My favorite quote from the show:
  > I was taught if we’re born with love, then life is about choosing the right place to put it. People talk about that a lot, it feeling right. When it feels right, it’s easy. But I’m not sure that’s true. It takes strength to know what’s right. And love isn’t something that weak people do. Being a romantic takes a hell of a lot of hope. I think what they mean is… when you find somebody that you love, it feels like hope.

### 2. Friends
- *Created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman*
- *Genre: sitcom*
- This show is such a comfort series of mine. The story follows six friends navigating their life in New York City, dealing with taking risks and keeping things real. I gotta say, you gotta love Chandler Bing!
- My favorite quote from the show:
  > I'm not great at advice. Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?

### 2. The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.
- *Written by Shuichi Aso*
- *Directed by Yuichi Fukuda*
- *Genre: comedy*
- Another comfort series of mine! This follows a young man Saiki Kusuo who was born with psychic abilities. To live a peacfeul life, he tries to be normal and mediocre. He hides his powers to others, but the chaotic friends he made changed his peaceful life to a disastrous one. A bit embarrassing to admit, but this show made me laugh out loud. Truly hilarious. 
- My favorite quote from the show:
  > Good grief (やれやれ).

## My Favorite Movies

### 1. Peter Pan (1953)
- *Directed by Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson Hamilton Luske*
- *Genre: fantasy, children's literature*
- This movie is my favorite growing up. This is based on J.M. Barrie's play named Peter Pan or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up. As a child, there are a lot of things that made me love it right away -- flying, a shadow trying to escape being a shadow, pixie dusts, pirates, crocodiles and whatnot. 
- My favorite quote from the show:
  > The moment you doubt whether you can fly, you cease forever to be able to do it.

### 2. Memento (2000)
- *Written by Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan*
- *Directed by Christopher Nolan*
- *Genre: mystery, psychological thriller*
- I loved my time watching this movie. This movie is about a man with a short-term memory loss out for vengeance. I am just deeply impressed by how creative the film was executed because in a way, it made audiences see what is happening through the perspective of the protagonist. It keeps me guessing, which is something I love in watching movies. I wish I could watch it again for the first time.
- My favorite quote from the show:
  > I can't remember to forget you.

### 3. My Tomorrow, Your Yesterday (2016)
- *Written by Yoshida Tomoko*
- *Directed by Miki Takahiro*
- *Genre: sci-fi, romance*
- This movie is heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. It started with a young man who fell in love with a woman on the train. The first minutes of it is kind of complicated and confused me, but as it went on, I was able to catch up what is going on and even its title made sense. 
- My favorite quote from the show:
  > We'll see each other again. See you.
